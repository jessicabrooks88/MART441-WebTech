This one confused me a lot! Mostly because it's hard to figure out where to plug which one into where (see, even talking about it is confusing). What I did to solve this issue was look at the pattern from the example you gave us. Once I looked at that, it took a long time to figure it out, but writing it out seemed to help me organize it. I believe that I was able to do the style sheet and index correctly this week. The script I think I was also successful at, except for the bottom variables that included the quit/restart function. I may need to add more but I am also having issues running code as well, so I can only tell from looking at the code versus running it. As difficult as this assignment was, it was the one I came away learning the most from and I hope that means that Week 4 will be easier for me to grasp! I also loved making up the story, which was based on my cat Boo Boo, who loves to get into trouble while I'm at work.
