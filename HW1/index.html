                <h1>My Main Theme</h1>
                <p>I have chosen a simple theme for this website</p>
                <p>because I want to get the basics down. I have chosen to take the code that was already provided and input what I would like my website to look like.
                    This may not be what was being asked, but it's a start. I hope to improve in the coming weeks and be able to do more than edit code. I would like
                    to be able to make code from scratch and remember what I learned more accurately from our previous class, MART 341.

I'm not sure what I want to do with my degree yet, but I always wanted to go to college and just the idea of having a degree when I never believed I could is a huge accomplishment for me.

                    <div class="menu-item">- I love to write. I have been writing short stories since I was a little kid. My favorite authors are Kurt Vonnegut, Bret Easton Ellis, Sam Pink, J.D. Salinger, and Mark Z. Danielewski.</div>
                    <div class="menu-item">- I really enjoyed learning how to use Touch Designer while I studied at UMT. I'm not good at it, but I hope to get better in my free time.</div>
                    <div class="menu-item">- My favorite thing to do right now is cook. I discovered that I loved cooking when the pandemic first began and I haven't stopped since. It makes me so happy to cook for other people and try out new recipes. It's a great way to show you care about someone.</div>
                    <div class="menu-item">- I have a full time job at a restaurant, so I spend a lot of time there. When I'm not working, I love to spend time with my boyfriend and our 3 adorable cats: Boo Boo, Luci, and Catbug.</div>

                            <p>I have seen the world take many forms. I don't think it has ever been a place that stays the same. It bends and shapes itself to it surroundings, whether that be a change in climate, a cultural shift, a political one, the world is always evolving with and bending to the will the people that inhabit it.</p>
                            <p>It would be nice to see the world take a kinder turn. I've stopped watching the news, stopped discussing politics, stopped wondering when things will get better. If there is any hope for the Earth, it has to start with the individual. That's why I try my best every day to improve myself and love the people I hold close to me as much as I can. Life is fleeting, but that doesn't mean it has to be a bad or scary thing. Any amount of time is a gift here, even when the world is burning, there is still plenty of beauty to be seen in the fire. All we can do is hope it gets better and that people will begin to appreciate what they have and not what</p>
