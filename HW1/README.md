I was able to edit the code from the live website to input my own information. However, I'm not able to figure out how to get the style sheet to show up and translate onto the website. I also only saw one image used in the style sheet so I only changed the background and the font colors. When I run the code, my website does show up, but none of the things I input into the stylesheet appear, so it is a black and white website in Times New Roman. I'm willing to go back and fix this if you could maybe send me a tutorial on how to do it or provide some links because I don't know where to start. But I was happy I was at least able to turn something in.
