I had an error come up when writing the oop.html regarding the return to string line. I think it was trying to say that the code was redundant but I couldn't figure out which one I needed and which one I didn't. My thought process was that if I had two different classes with objects that needed to be addressed, then I would need it to return to string twice with different outcomes. I am however seeing a pattern between what we learned when we did if, then variables and that it seems when doing Java, if you are trying to create an array it is necessary to have your patterns match up, otherwise they will not work. I'm not sure if I was successful in that since I got the error, but I did learn a lot about how OOP's work and how "this" is used in the context of java.
