I was happy with this one. Again, it was fun to write a story. But I also felt like I understood what I was doing a lot better this time. It's probably not anywhere close to perfect, but I think I followed the instructions properly and this is the first assignment I've done where I didn't feel completely lost, which means I'm learning! Awesome milestone. I do understand the concept of *what* I am trying to do when it comes to variables even if I am not masterful on how to execute it yet. But I am finding it easier to know where to plug in the code and what to put there.
