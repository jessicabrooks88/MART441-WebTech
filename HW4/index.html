       Bob had lost direction in his life. He had experienced the deepest kind of sadness, loneliness, and emptiness.
        <br>
        But he had experienced enough effortless, meaningful joy in his life to remember what it was like. And so he walked, aimlessly, until he found something that could help him remember.
         <br>
        
        It felt like he had been traveling for days, when he came upon two doors nestled deep in the forest.
        <br>
        The left door was blue. The right door was red. His body was tired and he knew this was the place. He had to make a decision.
