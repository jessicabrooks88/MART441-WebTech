For my final project, I chose to work with vanilla javascript for a simple animation game. The objects are two squares and you have to jump as the small square to avoid hitting the bigger square. I decided to use JS because I had the most success with understanding it throughout the semester. Still will look more into jQuery in my free time! I thought making this little game was fun even though it was challenging and I did struggle with the JS part, although I was able to figure out the html pretty easily (that's what I've always had the easiest time with). This class taught me a lot and I look forward to trying to learn more in the future, maybe keep making these little games because it was satisfying when I got it to work.
