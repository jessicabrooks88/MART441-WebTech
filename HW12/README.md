For this assignment, I decided to use the same method as last time. So I began by opening the course website and following along with the example. This worked a bit better for me and I started with the html file first. From there I moved onto the jquery file and the script files, trying to understand between each of the examples. I still don't really understand jQuery but I am understanding the js files in general much better than in previous weeks. The Hands-On section was especially helpful, as I tried to run several image attempts through the code display. For my assignment, I actually changed the music and video as well. I like to do that because I want to make sure I know where things are supposed to be plugged in.
