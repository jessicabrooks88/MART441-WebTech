This assignment fit in with what we learned this semester because of what node.js does and that it uses JS. It is for "building fast and scalable network applications" that are written in Javascript. It is able to provide service to a much larger number of requests even though it is a single threaded program, which makes it faster and more efficient. I tried to go through the index and the json file to set up my callbacks but I did not successfully understand how to use node.js. There was so much new information this week and I haven't gotten a full understanding of json or jquery yet to add new information into the equation, but I will keep trying to figure out how to use node through the course website exercise. I was sure of what the outcome of the code would be had I been able to get it to run correctly, but I wasn't having luck with the node.js particularly.
