I was unsure of where I needed to put the script tags. I know they belong in the html as indicated by the assignment, but then I figured I needed to copy and paste into the .js file as well. I think my biggest concern with these assignments is not understanding how to make the pages all run together. Like, last week with the css stye sheet not working and now I'm not sure how to get the script to work either. However I am starting to understand how the index pages work at least and am feeling more comfortable with the html.
