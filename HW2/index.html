        My 3 favorite websites are: Reddit, Instagram, and YouTube<br>
        My 3 favorite games are: Diablo II, The Sims, and Grand Theft Auto<br>
        My 3 favorite artists are: Radiohead, MF Doom, and Notorious BIG. I think these are all culturally relevant artists because people still listen to them long after they've passed or stopped making music.<br>
