I tried my best with this one but it was really difficult to understand the material. I used the live example to better understand where to put everything but I decided to choose a different subject matter (cars vs. bikes) so I could see where the changing information should go. I had the most trouble with the jQuery pages. I think I will spend more time trying to apply the code after learning the concepts of what jQuery does a little better in relation to ajax and json. It was just a lot of information at once but I'm sure with lots of practice I'll be able to understand how everything connects. That being said, I did feel a little more comfortable after attempting this assignment. Just like most assignments in the class, trying to learn it and apply it gets you at least a little closer to understanding the material, even if you're not 100% sure what you are doing. I plan on spending more time brushing up on these skills. I definitely learn more each week by trusting the process.
