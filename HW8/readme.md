I wasn't sure where to look to figure out how to add shapes to the code that move. I wanted to add images but did not know where to put them, or if I should put them in place of the text. I was able to animate the text by having it fade in and out but I definitely need more practice in understanding how to use jQuery. I did, however, learn about what I can do with jQuery, the origin of it, and why people still want to use it.
