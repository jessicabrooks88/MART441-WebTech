For this assignment, I decided to take a different approach to figuring out how to tackle the issue of "what goes where." I used the example but I went step by step through the Week 11 course website and tried to understand the material by using a mash-up of the code provided in the example and the code provided in each step from the website. I found this to be a lot easier to understand. I ended up not needing some of the pages from the example and was able to figure out where to put them within other html and js files. This assignment was easier to understand conceptually as I remember we studied this in MART 341, using a different program to run it than visual studio code. I was better able to visualize how the objects would collide and how to draw the squares in this one, so next time I will go through the course website again along with the example and see if it helps.
