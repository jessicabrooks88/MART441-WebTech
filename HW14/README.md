This week I used a combination of the example provided and some of the script from the course website. I did this because as I had done in previous weeks, I follow along with a combination of both. I was not able to install the threemin.js after I downloaded it because I did not see a way to install it. However, I did include it in the script in hopes that it would work. I drew most of my code for the index from the course website. I am understanding that we are supposed to be able to create moveable text from this and I did interject my own text and create my own code for that part in the index. The model files were harder to understand this week than what we went over regarding text in the lesson. I will try to keep working on this so I can improve.
